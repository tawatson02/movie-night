# Movie-Night

## Description
Our app allows you to generate a random movie and show you details of it, like the title, poster, summary, and rating. Along with that, it will also show the places where the movie can be streamed, if available. I think everyone here has experienced scrolling through Netflix or Hulu for an hour and never choosing anything. We wanted to create an app that can help eliminate this fatigue. Also, this app shows a lot of different kinds of movies, so you will most likely be shown something you’ve never seen. This helped us generate our user story “AS A movie buff, I WANT to generate a random movie with streaming info SO THAT my friends and I can watch something new”.



## Usage
Generate a random movie, along with showing the streaming information by pushing the "Random" button. The "Back" button will give you your last generated movie recommendation.
